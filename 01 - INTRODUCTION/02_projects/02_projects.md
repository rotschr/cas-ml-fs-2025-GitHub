# Individual Projects

Programming is all about *learning by doing* (or *trial and error*:)). For this reason, in the two-day intensive course, you won’t just be fed content. You’ll spend at least half the time working on a group project of your own. I’ll be happy to assist you with practical tips along the way.

## Project Description

- Form groups of three
- Find one, or ideally several, datasets that interest you, for example, on [opendata.swiss](https://opendata.swiss/de) or on [data.stadt-zuerich.ch](https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/)
    - It’s a good idea to select *CSV* as the data format in the filter options.
- Sketch an idea. What do you want to discover or demonstrate with these datasets?
- Load the datasets using Python and Jupyter Notebooks / JupyterLab
- Process the data: filter, aggregate, join
- Visualize the results
- Present your findings

During the two course days, you’ll regularly have time to work on your project. Project work will be interspersed with structured content on various Python topics (Basics, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, etc.).

It doesn’t matter how far you get with the project. The main goal is to apply what you've learned independently.

Have fun!
