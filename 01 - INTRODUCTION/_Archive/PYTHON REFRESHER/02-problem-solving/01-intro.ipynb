    "Ability  to understand, dissect, and solve complex problems, often trained and tested\n",
    "through coding, system design, or algorithmic challenges. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving such problems trains/test various highly desirable skills, even far outside the software domain:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Thinking**: Requires a logical and systematic approach to problems\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creativity**: Forces to think outside the box, find innovative solutions and maintain mental flexibility\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Proficiency**: Improves programmatic literacy and use of optimal data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attention to Detail**: Optimal solutions can only found by taking every aspect of the problem into account\n",
    "\n",
    "**Efficiency**: Forces practical decisions that balance time and space complexities\n",
    "\n",
    "**Communication Skills**: In interview situations, tests the candidates' ability to\n",
