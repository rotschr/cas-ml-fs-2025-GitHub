# Welcome!

### History of Python

- **1991**: Created by Guido van Rossum and released in February. Named after the
  British comedy group Monty Python
- **2000**: Python 2.0 was released with many major new features, including a full
  garbage collector and support for Unicode
- **2008**: Python 3.0 was released. Rectified fundamental design flaws in the language
- **2018**: Guido stepped down as the BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life) of Python,
  making way for a five-member "Steering Council" to guide its development
- **2020**: Python 2 was officially discontinued, Python 3 is now the only supported version
- **Today**: Python is used by many large companies and has been instrumental in the
  development of technologies such as YouTube, Instagram, and Dropbox

### Technical aspects

- **Interpreted Language**: Python code is executed "line by line", which makes debugging
  easier but may result in slower execution compared to compiled languages
- **High-Level Language**: Python abstracts many details of the computer hardware,
  making development faster and reducing the risk of programming errors
- **Dynamically Typed**: Variables in Python do not need to be declared with any
  specific type and can change type after they have been set
- **Indentation Syntax**: Python uses indentation to define blocks of code, unlike other
  languages that use braces. This makes the code visually cleaner and enforces
  readability
- **Extensive Standard Library**
- **Object-Oriented**: Everything in Python is an object, and Python supports concepts
  such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Python has a vast ecosystem of third-party packages and
  frameworks, which makes it suitable for almost any application
- **Embeddable and Extensible**: Python can be embedded within C/C++ programs, allowing
  for scripting capabilities within those applications. Conversely, Python can be
  extended with C/C++ for performance-critical parts
- **Interactive Mode**: Python comes with an interactive shell that allows developers to
  execute commands and scripts incrementally, facilitating testing and debugging
- **Cross-Platform**: Python is available and runs on various operating systems,
  including Windows, Linux, and macOS
- **Many implementations**: CPython, IronPython, PyPy, Stackless Python, MicroPython,
  CircuitPython, Jython
- **Influenced by**: ABC, Ada, ALGOL 68, APL, C, C++, CLU, Dylan, Haskell, Icon, Lisp,
  Modula-3, Perl, Standard ML
- **Influenced**: Apache Groovy, Boo, Cobra, CoffeeScript, D, F#, GDScript, Genie, Go,
  JavaScript, Julia, Mojo, Nim, Ring, Ruby, Swift

### Core Philosophy

Zen of Python (PEP 20), e.g.:

- Beautiful is better than ugly
- Explicit is better than implicit
- Simple is better than complex
- Complex is better than complicated
- Readability counts
