# Installing Anaconda

In this course, weâ€™ll be using Anaconda. Anaconda includes a Python installation and many useful tools, such as *JupyterLab* and *Jupyter Notebooks*.

- Please follow the instructions on the Anaconda homepage for installation: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/

- Choose the *Graphical Installer*

Once the installation is complete, you can open Anaconda and select JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebooks from the tool overview to work with Python notebooks. I recommend using JupyterLab.
