# Unsupervised Learning

## Data Set Information
The concepts will be taught with the help of a lego data set created by myself by scraping a toy website. 
The data set is prepared in advance and ready for use. 

The data set can be downloaded here on github under the folder `data` or on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s7wTVpTldaoaDjkPHIiuqHwHTbBeD8b0/view?usp=share_link). 

For the code notebooks the data needs to be loaded in your google drive or in google colab. 
Here a [link](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/io.ipynb) to mount the drive in Google.
