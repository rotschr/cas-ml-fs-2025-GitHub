# Unsupervised Learning - Hands On
**Author**: Dr. Yves Staudt

## Description Class
In this classes we treat unsupervised learning, namely

- clustering
- dimension reduction.

In clustering we treat 
- k-means clustering
- hierarchical clustering

In dimension reduction we treat 
- principal component analysis (PCA)
- t-distributed stochastic neighboring.

## Data Set Information
The concepts will be taught with the help of a lego data set created by myself by scraping a toy website. 
The data set is prepared in advance and ready for use. 

The data set can be downloaded here on github under the folder `data` or on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s7wTVpTldaoaDjkPHIiuqHwHTbBeD8b0/view?usp=share_link). 

For the code notebooks the data needs to be loaded in your google drive or in google colab. 
Here a [link](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/io.ipynb) to mount the drive in Google. 

## Code Notebooks
All Code Notebooks are saved on the Github under `code` folder or are accessible on Google Drive. 
To exercsie Exercise Code Notebooks are avaible on Github or on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zcY4OQ1kW4B8zeosEM5Ab2fqD0-oH9se?usp=share_link).

**Attention**: All file pathes need to be udpdate for the load of the data. 

The solutions are given on both sides too. Here the link for the solutions on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LARWvjDaBIq0bHZy7SYNtusCu0lqxxLp?usp=share_link). 

All the documents are available here on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cejMVA6PI63Dz31ZtIqfF_BDljN1wUzn?usp=share_link).
Please copy the folder before use.

## Requirements Coding
The codes are given in python. I use a conda version. The needed requirements are given in the `requirement.txt` file. 
Best is to create a new conda version with the `requirement.txt` file with the following command `conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt`

The used packages are
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- plotly
- matplotlib
- searborn
- scipy
