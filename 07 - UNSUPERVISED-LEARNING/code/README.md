# Unsupervised Learning - Hands On
**Author**: Dr. Yves Staudt

## Code Notebooks
All Code Notebooks are saved on the Github under `code` folder or are accessible on Google Drive. 
To exercise Exercise Code Notebooks are avaible on Github or on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zcY4OQ1kW4B8zeosEM5Ab2fqD0-oH9se?usp=share_link).

**Attention**: All file paths need to be updated for the load of the data. 

The solutions are given on both sides too. Here the link for the solutions on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LARWvjDaBIq0bHZy7SYNtusCu0lqxxLp?usp=share_link). 

All the documents are available here on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cejMVA6PI63Dz31ZtIqfF_BDljN1wUzn?usp=share_link).
Please copy the folder before use.

## Requirements Coding
The codes are given in python. I use a conda version. The needed requirements are given in the `requirement.txt` file. 
Best is to create a new conda version with the `requirement.txt` file with the following command `conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt`

The used packages are
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- plotly
- matplotlib
- searborn
- scipy
