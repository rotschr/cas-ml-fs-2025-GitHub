# Transformers
# Advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP): Exploring Large Language Models (LLMs) and Their Applications
**Author**: Dr. Elena Nazarenko

## Description
In this class we cover:

- Prompt Engineering
- Transformers
- Transformer-Based Contextual Sentence Classification
- Basic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain and Claude.ai Model
- Fine-tune Gemma on Medical Dataset

## Infrastructure
We will use google colab to train transformer's model
